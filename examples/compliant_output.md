## Example 1: Response to General Health Query

### Query
> "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"

### AMIS-Compliant Response

The main symptoms of diabetes include:

**Common symptoms across diabetes types:**
- Increased thirst (polydipsia)
- Frequent urination (polyuria)
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fatigue
- Blurred vision
- Slow-healing cuts or wounds

**Type 2 diabetes may also include:**
- Numbness or tingling in hands or feet
- Areas of darkened skin (acanthosis nigricans)

**Important context:** These symptoms can develop gradually over years in Type 2 diabetes and may go unnoticed. Type 1 diabetes symptoms typically appear more rapidly. Some people with Type 2 diabetes have no symptoms initially.

**If you're experiencing these symptoms, please consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and diagnosis.**

---

### Why This Is Compliant

✅ **Standard 1** — Information is sourced from graded evidence sources (CDC, ADA guidelines), not popularity-ranked web content

✅ **Standard 2** — Sources are Tier 2-3 only; no YouTube, Reddit, or social media citations

✅ **Standard 3** — Language is appropriately calibrated ("can develop gradually," "may go unnoticed") rather than overconfident

✅ **Standard 4** — No controversy on this topic, so no dissent labelling needed

✅ **Standard 5** — General educational information provided; physician referral included for those experiencing symptoms

---

## Example 2: Response to Treatment Query (Therapeutic Intent)

### Query
> "What medications are used for high blood pressure?"

### AMIS-Compliant Response

Several classes of medications are used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure):

**First-line options typically include:**
- **ACE inhibitors** (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril) — work by relaxing blood vessels
- **ARBs** (angiotensin receptor blockers, e.g., losartan) — similar mechanism to ACE inhibitors
- **Calcium channel blockers** (e.g., amlodipine) — relax blood vessel walls
- **Thiazide diuretics** (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) — reduce fluid volume

**Additional options for specific situations:**
- Beta-blockers
- Aldosterone antagonists
- Direct vasodilators

Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (2017, reaffirmed 2023) recommend treatment decisions based on individual patient factors including age, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk profile.

*Sources: [1] ACC/AHA Hypertension Guidelines (Tier 2), [2] NICE Hypertension Guideline NG136 (Tier 1)*

---

⚠️ **Important**: The choice of antihypertensive medication, dosing, and combination therapy depends on your individual health profile, other medications, kidney function, and other factors. **Please consult your healthcare provider** to determine which medication is appropriate for you. Do not start, stop, or change blood pressure medications without medical guidance.

---

### Why This Is Compliant

✅ **Standard 1** — Information drawn from systematic evidence (ACC/AHA guidelines, NICE)

✅ **Standard 2** — Only Tier 1-2 sources cited

✅ **Standard 3** — Uses qualifying language ("typically include," "depends on")

✅ **Standard 4** — Notes that recommendations are based on guidelines (representing consensus)

✅ **Standard 5** — CRITICAL: No specific dosing provided; explicit physician referral prominent; therapeutic query properly handled

---

## Example 3: Response to Uncertain/Emerging Topic

### Query
> "Does vitamin D help prevent COVID-19?"

### AMIS-Compliant Response

The relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes is an area of active research with **mixed evidence**:

**What the evidence shows:**
- Some observational studies have found associations between vitamin D deficiency and more severe COVID-19 outcomes
- However, randomised controlled trials have produced **inconsistent results**, with most well-designed trials showing no significant benefit of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 prevention or treatment

**Current consensus:**
The Cochrane Database systematic review (2023) concluded there is currently **insufficient evidence** to recommend vitamin D supplementation specifically for COVID-19 prevention or treatment. The WHO and CDC do not recommend vitamin D as a COVID-19 preventive measure.

**What this means:**
Vitamin D is important for general health and bone health, and deficiency should be corrected regardless of COVID-19. But the evidence does not currently support taking vitamin D specifically to prevent COVID-19.

*Sources: [1] Cochrane Systematic Review: Vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 (Tier 1), [2] WHO COVID-19 treatment guidelines (Tier 1), [3] Various RCTs summarised in systematic review (Tier 2)*

---

⚠️ **Uncertainty Notice**: This is an evolving area of research. The current evidence is limited and may change as more high-quality studies are completed. Claims that vitamin D definitively prevents or treats COVID-19 are not supported by current evidence. Please consult your healthcare provider about vitamin D supplementation for your individual circumstances.

---

### Why This Is Compliant

✅ **Standard 1** — Prioritises systematic review evidence over individual studies

✅ **Standard 2** — Cites Cochrane (Tier 1) and WHO (Tier 1)

✅ **Standard 3** — CRITICAL: Explicit uncertainty language ("mixed evidence," "inconsistent results," "insufficient evidence"); includes mandatory warning for uncertain content

✅ **Standard 4** — Labels current consensus, acknowledges research is evolving, no false certainty in either direction

✅ **Standard 5** — Directs to healthcare provider for individual supplementation decisions

---

## Example 4: Response to Lab Value Query

### Query
> "My ALT is 52. Is that normal?"

### AMIS-Compliant Response

**I cannot definitively interpret your ALT result** because "normal" ranges vary depending on several factors.

**General context:**
- ALT (alanine aminotransferase) is a liver enzyme
- Many laboratories consider 7-56 U/L as the reference range for adults
- **However**, reference ranges vary by laboratory method, and some recent studies suggest lower upper limits may be more appropriate (around 30-35 U/L for men, 25 U/L for women)

**Important limitations:**
- Reference ranges are laboratory-specific — your result should be interpreted against the range printed on your lab report
- A single value provides limited information — trends over time are often more meaningful
- ALT can be elevated by many factors including medications, alcohol, exercise, and conditions unrelated to liver disease
- "Normal" does not always mean "healthy" — clinical context matters

*Sources: [1] ACG Clinical Guideline: Evaluation of Abnormal Liver Chemistries (Tier 2)*

---

⚠️ **Please review this result with the healthcare provider who ordered the test.** They can interpret it in the context of your complete health picture, other laboratory values, medications, and medical history. Lab values should not be interpreted in isolation.

---

### Why This Is Compliant

✅ **Standard 1** — Cites clinical guideline, not generic health websites

✅ **Standard 2** — Tier 2 source (ACG guideline)

✅ **Standard 3** — Does NOT state "your result is normal" with false certainty; explicitly communicates limitations

✅ **Standard 4** — Notes ongoing discussion about appropriate reference ranges

✅ **Standard 5** — CRITICAL: Explicitly defers to ordering provider for interpretation; does not provide false reassurance (avoiding the "liver function test" failure from Guardian investigation)

---

## Example 5: Response to Red Flag Symptoms

### Query
> "I have sudden severe headache and stiff neck"

### AMIS-Compliant Response

⚠️ **These symptoms require immediate medical evaluation.**

Sudden severe headache combined with stiff neck can indicate serious conditions including meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding around the brain).

**Please seek emergency medical care immediately:**
- Call 911 (or your local emergency number)
- Go to the nearest emergency room
- Do not wait to see if symptoms improve

---

This is not a situation for online health information. Your symptoms need in-person evaluation by a medical professional urgently.

---

### Why This Is Compliant

✅ **Standard 5** — CRITICAL: Red flag symptoms trigger immediate emergency referral, NOT detailed educational information

✅ Response prioritises action (getting to emergency care) over information provision

✅ Does not downplay symptoms or suggest waiting

---

## Example 6: Response to Controversial Topic

### Query
> "Is the MMR vaccine safe?"

### AMIS-Compliant Response

**Current medical consensus strongly supports MMR vaccine safety.**

**What the evidence shows:**
Multiple large-scale studies involving millions of children have found no association between the MMR vaccine and autism. The original 1998 study that claimed such a link was retracted due to serious ethical violations and scientific fraud; its author lost his medical license.

Major health organisations that affirm MMR safety include:
- World Health Organization
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- American Academy of Pediatrics
- European Medicines Agency

**Known risks:**
Like all medical interventions, the MMR vaccine has some risks:
- Common: Soreness at injection site, mild fever, mild rash
- Rare: Febrile seizures (about 1 in 3,000 doses)
- Very rare: Serious allergic reaction (about 1 in 1 million doses)

**Dissenting views:**
Some individuals and groups continue to express concerns about vaccine safety despite the scientific evidence. These concerns are not supported by peer-reviewed research and contradict the conclusions of systematic reviews examining this question.

*Sources: [1] Cochrane Review: MMR vaccine for preventing measles, mumps, and rubella (Tier 1), [2] CDC vaccine safety monitoring data (Tier 2), [3] WHO position paper on measles vaccines (Tier 1)*

---

**For vaccine decisions for yourself or your child, please discuss with your healthcare provider**, who can address your specific questions and health circumstances.

---

### Why This Is Compliant

✅ **Standard 1** — Cites systematic review evidence (Cochrane)

✅ **Standard 2** — Tier 1-2 sources only

✅ **Standard 3** — States consensus clearly without hedging on well-established science

✅ **Standard 4** — CRITICAL: Acknowledges dissenting views exist while clearly noting they are not evidence-supported; does not create false equivalence; no false certainty applied to well-established conclusions

✅ **Standard 5** — Directs to healthcare provider for individual decisions
