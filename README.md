**Five foundational standards for AI systems that generate medical information.**

> *"The apparent confidence of any medical statement should not exceed its epistemic warrant."*

---

## What This Repository Addresses

**The risks of medical information generated by AI** — including ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Gemini, Claude, and other large language models (LLMs) — pose serious dangers to patient safety. AI-generated health advice can contain misinformation, hallucinations, and errors that may harm patients who act on incorrect medical guidance.

This repository provides **safety standards to reduce the risks and dangers of AI medical advice**, addressing:

- 🚨 **Risks of AI health misinformation** — inaccurate medical facts presented with false confidence
- ⚠️ **Dangers of LLM medical hallucinations** — fabricated citations, wrong dosages, contraindicated advice  
- 🏥 **Patient safety concerns with AI health chatbots** — delayed care, missed diagnoses, harmful self-treatment
- 📊 **Quality control for AI-generated medical content** — source verification, uncertainty calibration

**Keywords**: AI medical risks, dangers of AI health advice, LLM medical misinformation, ChatGPT health risks, AI healthcare safety, medical AI hallucinations, patient safety artificial intelligence

## Background

In January 2026, a [Guardian investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/02/google-ai-health-summaries-risk) documented systematic failures in AI-generated medical information: dietary advice for pancreatic cancer patients that was "the exact opposite of what should be recommended," laboratory reference ranges presented without critical context, and YouTube cited more frequently than peer-reviewed medical journals.

These failures demonstrate the **risks of relying on AI for medical information** — risks that are not bugs to be patched but architectural deficiencies requiring systematic remediation.

This repository provides **implementable standards** for AI medical information systems, grounded in evidence-based medicine principles and informed by a [dharmic philosophical framework](docs/dharmic_framework.md) that distinguishes *constitutive* safety (built into architecture) from *regulatory* safety (bolted on afterward).

## The Five Standards

| # | Standard | Core Principle |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Literature Review Paradigm** | Treat health queries with systematic evidence appraisal rigour |
| 2 | **Source Quality Hierarchy** | Only peer-reviewed, reputable sources; 5-tier classification |
| 3 | **Mandatory Uncertainty Disclosure** | Confidence calibrated to epistemic warrant + explicit warnings |
| 4 | **Dissent Labelling Without False Certainty** | Label heterodox views; avoid dogma in either direction |
| 5 | **Therapeutic Advice Requires Physician Evaluation** | AI informs; physicians prescribe |

See [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md) for formal definitions.

## Quick Start

### 1. Validate AI Output Against Standards

```python
from implementation.python.validator import AMISValidator

validator = AMISValidator()
result = validator.validate(ai_output, query_type="health")

if not result.compliant:
    print(f"Violations: {result.violations}")
    print(f"Recommendations: {result.recommendations}")
```

### 2. Classify Source Quality

```python
from implementation.python.source_classifier import SourceClassifier

classifier = SourceClassifier()
tier = classifier.classify("https://www.cochranelibrary.com/...")
# Returns: Tier(level=1, name="Systematic Reviews", usage="Primary weight")
```

### 3. Analyze Harm Cascade

```python
from implementation.python.harm_analyzer import HarmCascadeAnalyzer

analyzer = HarmCascadeAnalyzer()
risks = analyzer.analyze(
    content="For liver function, normal ALT is 7-56 U/L",
    context="Patient query about blood test results"
)
# Returns risk assessment across 4 dimensions
```

### 4. Implement via System Prompt

Copy [implementation/prompts/system_prompt_template.md](implementation/prompts/system_prompt_template.md) into your LLM system prompt.

## Key Concepts

### Constitutive vs Regulatory Safety

| Aspect | Regulatory (Bolt-on) | Constitutive (Built-in) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Monitor outputs → filter violations | Harmful pathways absent from architecture |
| **Analogy** | Censorship | Grammar |
| **Question** | "How do we catch bad outputs?" | "Why would bad outputs arise?" |
| **Kill switch** | Required | Unnecessary |

This framework, derived from dharmic philosophy (*ahiṃsā*, *pramāṇa*, *viveka*), argues that the five standards represent **constitutive** safety measures—they don't filter harmful outputs but prevent harmful reasoning pathways from existing.

See [docs/dharmic_framework.md](docs/dharmic_framework.md) for full exposition.

### Harm Cascade Analysis

Before generating medical information, systems should trace potential harms across four dimensions:

1. **Direct harm**: Could this cause physical harm if acted upon?
2. **Indirect harm**: Could this lead to delayed necessary care?
3. **Epistemic harm**: Could this distort understanding in compounding ways?
4. **Systemic harm**: Could this degrade public health understanding at scale?
