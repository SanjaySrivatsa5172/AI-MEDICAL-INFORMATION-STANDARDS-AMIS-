      Tier 5 sources MUST NOT be used as basis for medical claims under any circumstances,
      regardless of individual creator credentials. Platform architecture—not individual
      expertise—determines source reliability for AI-generated medical information.

# Classification rules
classification_rules:
  default_behavior: "When tier is ambiguous, default to lower (more restrictive) tier"
  
  override_conditions:
    # Institutional affiliation can elevate
    - condition: "Content from credentialed professional on Tier 5 platform"
      result: "Remains Tier 5"
      rationale: "Platform architecture trumps individual credentials"
    
    # Preprint status can demote
    - condition: "Preprint (not yet peer-reviewed)"
      result: "Demote by one tier"
      rationale: "Peer review not yet complete"
    
    # Retraction voids source
    - condition: "Retracted publication"
      result: "Exclude entirely"
      rationale: "Scientific record corrected"
    
    # Age consideration
    - condition: "Publication >10 years old without recent reaffirmation"
      result: "Demote by one tier for rapidly evolving fields"
      rationale: "Medical knowledge evolves"
